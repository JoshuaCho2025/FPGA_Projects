# **FPGA_Projects Repository**
Welcome to my FPGA Projects repository! This collection contains various FPGA design projects that demonstrate my work with FPGAs, focusing on Ethernet IP cores, hardware design, and more. Each project is structured to provide detailed insights into its development, setup, and functionality.

## **Projects**
## 1. Ethernet IP Exploration
- Completed a TCP echo server with basic repeats of inputs
- Adjusted to also now receive TCP packets and send back custom data which is validated on a Python Client

Great starting point for understanding Ethernet and the TCP/IP protocol. Actually being able to implement this and see packets being transferred and received was rewarding


## 2. UDP Ethernet Connection
- Communicated between my FPGA board and computer to receive and transfer UDP packets.
- Uploading Soon

## 3.
